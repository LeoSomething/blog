The challenge file is a single C binary compiled with all protections.

![checksec](checksec.png)

Reversing the binary we can identify 4 main functionalities:

- `add_mark`: allows the user to allocate a chunk (adding it to a list) and write a mark (int) and a description (string) into it
- `remove_mark`: frees the chunk containing the mark and removes it from the list
- `change_mark`: change the data inside a previosly allocated chunk
- `save_mark`: spawns a thread and makes a post request to an arbitrary endpoint, sending the mark as payload. It also removes the chunk.

## Solution

### Race condition
The function `save_mark` seems suspicious because the call to free is made before the post request, but the pointer is removed from the list after it. This can trigger a race condition that can lead to a double free!\
As we can choose the url for the request, the race condition can have an arbitrary window, we just need to setup an endpoint with a sleep.

```php
<?php
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'POST') {
    $body = file_get_contents('php://input');
    $logFile = 'bodies.txt';
    file_put_contents($logFile, $body . PHP_EOL, FILE_APPEND); // stores the body of the request
    sleep(3); // just wait (arb window)
} else {
    echo "Make a POST request";
}
?>
```
*this is the simple endpoint I made. Please webbers, have mercy*

### Leak heap
Saving a file two times in a row allows us to leak the heap.\
This can be done because, after the first free, the saved mark becomes the "safe-linked" `chunk->fd` and if the chunk is the last in the linked list then `chunk->fd = heap>>12`.
We just need to guess the upper nibble of the heap, which is usually 0x5 or 0x6.

In short:
1. add chunk
2. save chunk (start race)
3. change chunk tcache-key
4. sleep for 1 sec (ensure requests arrive in the right order)
5. save chunk again (leak heap)
6. sleep for 2 sec (end race)

>Note that we need to change the tcache-key (second qword of the chunk) before saving the chunk a second time, otherwise we get a SIGABRT.


And now let's have some fun with feng shui!

### Partial libc leak
With some allocations we can get a chunk into unsortedbins and leak the lower 4 bytes of libc using `save_mark`.

![heap partial-lib-leak](heap_partial-libc-leak.png)

### Playing with tcache_perthread_struct
At this point the easiest way of arbitrary writing is to tamper with the `tcache_perthread_struct`, as we avoid messing with safe linking, but as we don't have a full libc leak we need to do some magic.

The idea is to free a chunk into unsortedbins so as to have a pointer to `main_arena` as the first entry in the 0x40 tcache linked list.\
To achieve this we need to move to smallbins the unsortedbin that we used to partial-leak libc, otherwise freeing another big chunk won't give us a pointer to libc. To do this we need to allocate a bunch of chunks.

![bins main-arena-tcache](bins_main-arena-tcache.png)

### Libc-leak method 1: stdout as read primitive
Once we have our pointer to `main_arena` as the first entry in 0x40 tcache we can partial override and make it an `_IO_2_1_stdout_`'s pointer.
Now we can allocate a chunk over stdout and partial override `_IO_write_base` to dump some bytes and fully leak libc (note that buffering is disabled for sdtout, so the buffer pointers in the file struct point inside the struct itself).\
>This tecnique is well explained by `nobodyisnobody` on [his github](https://github.com/nobodyisnobody/docs/tree/main/using.stdout.as.a.read.primitive).

### Libc-leak method 2: abuse safe-linking
Another way of leaking libc consists in partial overriding the `main_arena`'s pointer to make it point to a writable NULL region of libc.\
Allocating that chunk would trigger safe-linking (if the number of chunks in the 0x40 tcache is greater than 0).\
We are now in the same situation as when we leaked the heap: we can use the `save_mark` functionality to leak `libc>>12` and guess the upper nibble (0x7).

### Spawning a shell
Once we have leaked libc there are different paths one can take:

1. leak `environ` overriding `_IO_2_1_stdout_` a second time and then build a ROP chain on the stack of the `add_mark` function

2. Angry-FSROP on stdout

3. libc GOT override using a onegadget (not tested)

4. libc GOT override to stack pivot and ROP (basically [this tecnique](https://github.com/n132/Libc-GOT-Hijacking))
